## Welcome to GitHub Pages

I want to make a file that gets updated frequently so as to show all of the current ultimate frisbee scores that are obtained using twitter.

### Example

|   |Team One | Team Two |
|:--|-------: |-----:|
|Points| 1 | 2|

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Shmelder/shmelder.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
